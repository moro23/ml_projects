This repository contains five (5) machine learning projects that I have recently worked on. <br>
- Project_1: Consist of building a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone/tablet and identify factors that significantly influence it. Project name: Used_Phone_Price_Pridiction_Analysis
- Project_2: Consist of building a predictive model using a logistic regression algorithm that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds. Project name: INNHotels_Prediction_Analysis. 
- Project_3: Consist of building a Classification model using Bagging Classifier, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting algorithms to 
  - Facilitate the process of visa approvals 
  - Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied. 
 This project also include performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Importance and Feature Engineering. Lastly, the I performed Hyperparmater tuning to improve the of the models <br>
 project_name: Visa_Prediction_Analysis.
